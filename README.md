# ChessByLeo-Remake

It's been almost three years since my first coding project -- ChessByLeo (Dec, 2020). I have learned a few things since then and this is a remake of my first chess game. I will try to approach working on this game with the best practices I know of the langauge (C++), as well as architectural decisions. 

I will be putting a lot of focus on architecutre/design before I start coding as I believe it's the most important part to ensure a maintainable/clean codebase. Below you will find a link to a Figma page containing user stories, component workflows(represented in FSMs), requirements, and software architecture for the game. 

### Architecture Design
This will be my first attempt at video game architecture. I believe the traditional MVC/Clean Architecture are not applicable for a video game, so I will be trying out [Entity Component Systems](https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/understanding-component-entity-systems-r3013/)
